            <b><font color="#483D8B">How do I get into the course?</font></b>
            <br><br>

<p>If you haven't done so already, please <a href="https://waitlist.cis.upenn.edu/">apply to the waitlist</a> (the URL will indicate the opening date if it isn't already open).</p>

<p>The waitlist is processed periodically, so applying early helps.  Once you get a permit, accept or decline it as soon as possible.  <b>The permit expires after 24 hours.</b></p>

<p>Demand for this course can exceed the available slots each semester. So we have to prioritize enrollment based on factors such as your major, graduation year, and whether you applied to the waitlist in a previous semester. We do not make exceptions for students who haven't satisfied pre-requisites (programming, algorithms, mathematical foundations, and some experience with Javascript, HTML, or web programming). </p>

<p>As students finalize their schedule, slots tend to open up closer to the start of the semester, and especially during first week of classes.  <b>If you would like to be added as an Observer to access the course material on Canvas, please email TA (TBD).</b>  Thereafter, attend classes or participate online, and do the homeworks and exercises in the first week to convey your earnestness.</p>

<p>If you still aren't able to get in, you will be allowed to stay as an Observer for the rest of the semester and have full access to the course material.</p>

<p>Lastly, it helps to be flexible and make a backup plan in the event that you don't get in.  The course is offered every semester, and your priority increases each semester.</p>

            <b><font color="#483D8B">I have further questions about the waitlist.</font></b>
            <br><br>
	    <p>Please email ciswait@seas.upenn.edu</p>

            <b><font color="#483D8B">Can you allow me to take the class if I have a conflict with another course?</font></b>
            <br><br>
	    <p>No. You will need to drop the other class, take this class in a future semester, or sign up as an Observer (see above for how to do this).</p>
	    <br>

        <div class='col-md-12'>
            <b><font color="#483D8B">Can I take this class virtually?</font></b>
            <br><br>
	    <p>No. This class involves a significant group project and weekly hands-on recitations.  Taking the class virtually can adversely impact your and/or your groupmates' learning experience and performance.</p>

        <div class='col-md-12'>
            <b><font color="#483D8B">Should I sign up for 450 or 550? Is the content and grading identical for both?</font></b>
            <br><br>

	    <p>The two instances of the course are identical in all respects, including content and grading.  If you are already a submatriculant or accelerated Masters student, register for 550.  Otherwise, register for 450, even if you later take up submatriculation / accelerated Masters; at that point, you can contact the graduate program coordinator (Redian Furxhiu) to have 450 counted towards your Masters requirement.</p>
